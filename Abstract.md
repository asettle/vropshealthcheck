## Automate Troubleshooting with vRealize Operations Manager

Imagine you are working on a project with a rapidly approaching deadline and a coworker notifies you of an issue with a VM. VMware vRealize Operations Manager (vROps) is a powerful tool for monitoring, optimizing, and right sizing an environment but becomes even more powerful when combined with PowerCLI and vRealize Log Insight. In this session you will learn how to leverage PowerCLI to diagnose trouble VMs, how to transform your troubleshooting workflow into an automated runbook, and how to create an easy to consume report with clear results and suggestions to resolve the issue.

## Key Takeaways

* Use PowerCLI and vRealize Operations Manager to quickly diagnose trouble VMs
* Standardize your troubleshooting methodology With a simple starting point
* Create easily repeatable reports that clearly outline next steps
* Reduce Time spent keeping the lights on by troubleshooting smarter, not harder




Notes:
* Used Script because hyperic didn't work at time of creation. Investigate if the plugin and/or log insight can get event/application log and logs for linux
* Script is also a way to use vRealize Operations Standard, since custom dashboards and reports aren't an option
