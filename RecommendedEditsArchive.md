Purpose: Educating the audience to use vROps to save time investigating issues automate manual troubleshooting with PowerCLI and/or custom reports.

**Used Script because hyperic didn't work at time of creation. Investigate if the plugin and/or log insight can get event/application log and logs for linux**

## Key Takeaways

* Use PowerCLI and vRealize Operations Manager to quickly diagnose trouble VMs
* Standardize your troubleshooting methodology With a simple starting point
* Create easily repeatable reports that clearly outline next steps
* Reduce Time spent keeping the lights on by troubleshooting smarter, not harder

### Reduce Mean Time to Innocence with vRealize Operations Heath Check Script
^maybe shorten this

It's 4:55pm on Friday when a coworker arrives at your door tasking "Can you check out this VM for me?". Whether the issue is poor performance, a hung service, or an application error, VMware vSphere is a great place to find authoritative data and logging. VMware vRealize Operations Manager (vROps) is a powerful tool for monitoring, optimizing, and right sizing an environment but ~~sometimes navigating the interface can take longer than you want to wait~~ **(criticizing VMware won't get you selected)**. To combat this assault on my weekends, I developed the vROps health check script. I was able to reduce the time to gather usage statistics, configuration, and event logs from 30 minutes into seconds using only PowerCLI and Powershell. With PowerCLI 10.0, vROps 6.6, and vRealize Log Insight the process becomes even more efficient. When the weekend is moments away, every second counts.

Imagine you are about to leave work on Friday and a coworker notifies you of an issue with a VM. VMware vRealize Operations Manager (vROps) is a powerful tool for monitoring, optimizing, and right sizing an environment but becomes even more powerful when combined with PowerCLI 10.0 and vRealize Log Insight. **Now list two or three use cases you will discuss** In this session, you will learn xyz.
